# cornholeold

These are my old sketches for the LED cornhole using the esp-now protocol.

it uses 2 esp32's to talk to eachother. 

I only was implementing the LEDS on Board 2 for testing right now, and board 1 was just buttons to send data and recieve. 

if you want to make them both light up and work, you're going to have to modify led board 1 to include the stuff from led board 2 and also setup the sender and reciever part in the mac addresses.

# YOU HAVE TO REPLACE YOU MAC ADDRESSES FOR THIS TO WORK!
